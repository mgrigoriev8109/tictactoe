Reflections

- Tic Tac Toe was a great introduction to using classes and OOP concepts. I saw firsthand how important it is to plan your code beforehand. Having spent a day planning beforehand most of the program was very simple to code one piece at a time after I had planned out my proper classes, and instance methods. That said, I also ran into difficulties because I think I could have done a better job planning out the Winning Conditions, as this was something I didn't plan enough, and it took me more time than I expected.
